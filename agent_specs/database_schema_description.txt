#DATABASE DESCRIPTION (Bias and Fairness Analysis Database)
The Bias and Fairness Analysis database is designed to manage and analyze bias detection metrics, tools, datasets, critical domains, laws, and protected attributes. This database provides a structured approach to understanding bias in datasets and tools, as well as their legal implications. Below is a detailed description of the tables and their columns:

#bias_metrics_data
This table stores information about different bias metrics used for fairness evaluation.

##Columns:
id: (Integer) The unique identifier for each bias metric. Primary key.
name: (String) The name of the bias metric.
type_of_fairness: (String) The type of fairness the metric evaluates (e.g., "Individual, Group", "Subgroup", "Group").
target_variable_type: (String) The type of target variable the metric applies to (e.g., "Binary, Categorical, Numerical", "Binary, Categorical").
description: (String) A detailed explanation of the bias metric.

#bias_detection_tools
This table stores information about SOTA existing tools used for bias detection.

##Columns:
id: (Integer) The unique identifier for each bias detection tool. Primary key.
name: (String) The name of the bias detection tool.
is_open_source: (String) Indicates whether the tool is open-source (e.g. "Yes", "No").
num_and_des_supported_metrics: (String) The number and description of supported bias metrics (e.g. "18 (Disparity and performance metrics)").
type_of_fairness: (String) The type of fairness the tool evaluates "Group Fairness, Individual Fairness".
supported_data_types: (String) The types of data the tool supports (e.g., "Tabular datasets").
sensitive_feature_availability: (String) Describes if the tool required protected attribute name (e.g., "Yes").
description: (String) A brief description of the tool.

#datasets_data
This table contains details about datasets used in bias and fairness analysis.

##Columns:
dataset_name: (String) The name of the dataset. Primary key.
domain: (String) The domain or industry the dataset belongs to (e.g., healthcare, finance).
task: (String) The type of task associated with the dataset (e.g., classification, regression).
protected_attributes: (String) The list of protected attributes present in the dataset (e.g., gender, race).
bias_concerns: (String) The known bias concerns related to the dataset.

#critical_domains_data
This table maps datasets to critical domains where fairness is a key concern. many to many. example: ["Law Enforcement & Criminal Justice", "COMPAS"],["Law Enforcement & Criminal Justice", "ProPublica Violent Recidivism"].

##Columns:
critical_domain: (String) The critical domain name (e.g., "Law Enforcement & Criminal Justice").
dataset_name: (String) The name of the dataset used in this critical domain (e.g "COMPAS"). Foreign key referencing the datasets_data table.

#laws_data
This table stores information about laws related to fairness and bias in AI and data processing.

##Columns:
law_name: (String) The full name of the law.
law_abbreviation: (String) The abbreviation of the law (e.g., GDPR, Fair Housing Act). Primary key.

#protected_attributes_data
This table defines various protected attributes that are relevant in bias analysis.

##Columns:
protected_attribute: (String) The name of the protected attribute (e.g., age, gender, race). Primary key.
description: (String) A brief description of the protected attribute.

#protected_attributes_laws_data
This table establishes the relationship between protected attributes and the laws that govern them.

##Columns:
protected_attribute: (String) The protected attribute name. Foreign key referencing the protected_attributes_data table.
law_abbreviation: (String) The abbreviation of the law that protects this attribute. Foreign key referencing the laws_data table.
