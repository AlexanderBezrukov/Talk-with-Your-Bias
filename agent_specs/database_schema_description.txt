#DATABASE DESCRIPTION (Bias and Fairness Analysis Database)
The Bias and Fairness Analysis database is designed to manage and analyze bias detection metrics, tools, datasets, critical domains, laws, and protected attributes. This database provides a structured approach to understanding bias in datasets and tools, as well as their legal implications. Below is a detailed description of the tables and their columns:

#bias_metrics_data
This table stores information about different bias metrics used for fairness evaluation.

##Columns:
id: (Integer) The unique identifier for each bias metric. Primary key.
name: (String) The name of the bias metric.
type_of_fairness: (String) The type of fairness the metric evaluates (e.g., "Individual, Group", "Subgroup", "Group").
target_variable_type: (String) The type of target variable the metric applies to (e.g., "Binary, Categorical, Numerical", "Binary, Categorical").
description: (String) A detailed explanation of the bias metric.

#bias_detection_tools
This table stores information about SOTA existing tools used for bias detection.

##Columns:
id: (Integer) The unique identifier for each bias detection tool. Primary key.
name: (String) The name of the bias detection tool.
is_open_source: (String) Indicates whether the tool is open-source (e.g. "Yes", "No").
num_and_des_supported_metrics: (String) The number and description of supported bias metrics (e.g. "18 (Disparity and performance metrics)").
type_of_fairness: (String) The type of fairness the tool evaluates "Group Fairness, Individual Fairness".
supported_data_types: (String) The types of data the tool supports (e.g., "Tabular datasets").
sensitive_feature_availability: (String) Describes if the tool required protected attribute name (e.g., "Yes").
description: (String) A brief description of the tool.

#datasets_data
This table stores high-level information about SOTA real-world biased datasets commonly used to study bias and fairness in machine learning.

##Columns:
dataset_name: (String) The name of the dataset. Primary key.
critical_domain: (Enum: Law Enforcement & Criminal Justice, Employment & Worker Management, Healthcare, Finance, Education, Housing & Socioeconomics) The application critical area of the dataset (e.g., Criminal Justice, Finance, Healthcare).
task: (String) A short description of the prediction or classification goal associated with the dataset.
bias_concerns: (String)  A summary of known or documented bias concerns related to the dataset.
ml_task: (Enum: regression, binary classification, multiclass classification, multilabel classification, multiregression) The machine learning task type associated with the dataset.

#laws_data
This table stores information about laws related to fairness and bias in AI and data processing.

##Columns:
law_name: (String) The full name of the law.
law_abbreviation: (String) The abbreviation of the law (e.g., GDPR, Fair Housing Act). Primary key.

#protected_attributes_data
This table defines various protected attributes that are relevant in bias analysis.

##Columns:
protected_attribute: (String) The name of the protected attribute (e.g., age, gender, race). Primary key.
description: (String) A brief description of the protected attribute.

#protected_attributes_laws_data
This table establishes the relationship between protected attributes and the laws that govern them.

##Columns:
protected_attribute: (String) The protected attribute name. Foreign key referencing the protected_attributes_data table.
law_abbreviation: (String) The abbreviation of the law that protects this attribute. Foreign key referencing the laws_data table. Values are limited to: CRA, FHA, ECOA, EA, EU AI. It is a foreign key for laws_data to know the full law_name.

#protected_attributes_dataset_data
This link table maps datasets to the protected attributes they involve.
##Columns:
dataset_name: (String) Foreign Key - References datasets_data.dataset_name (from datasets_data table)
protected_attribute: (String) Foreign Key - References protected_attributes_data.protected_attribute (from protected_attributes_data or protected_attributes_laws_data tables)
