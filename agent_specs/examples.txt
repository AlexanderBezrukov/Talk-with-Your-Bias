#Example Queries
user: tell me about existing dataset in finance
SELECT dataset_name,
       domain,
       task,
       protected_attributes,
       bias_concerns
FROM   datasets_data
WHERE  domain like '%Finance%';

user: what are the tools to detect bias for finance
it means tools support tabular data, supported_data_types has values like "Tabular, Image" or "Tabular datasets"
SELECT name,
       is_open_source,
       num_and_des_supported_metrics,
       type_of_fairness,
       supported_data_types,
       sensitive_feature_availability,
       description
FROM   bias_detection_tools
WHERE supported_data_types LIKE '%Tabular%';

user: asking about AI EU Act
SELECT ALL
FROM   laws_data
WHERE  law_name like '%EU AI Act%';

user: give me existing biased datasets and tell what LAW act they violate
SELECT
    dd.dataset_name,
    dd.domain,
    dd.bias_concerns,
    pal.law_abbreviation,
    ld.law_name
FROM
    datasets_data dd
JOIN
    protected_attributes_data pad ON dd.protected_attributes LIKE '%' || pad.protected_attribute || '%'
JOIN
    protected_attributes_laws_data pal ON pad.protected_attribute = pal.protected_attribute
JOIN
    laws_data ld ON pal.law_abbreviation = ld.law_abbreviation
WHERE
    dd.bias_concerns IS NOT NULL;

user: Which datasets in the finance domain show bias, and how do they conflict with AI EU Law?
pay attention, datasets_data does not have protected_attributes field but should be connected via dataset_name and critical_domain
