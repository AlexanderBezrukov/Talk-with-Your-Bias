# Knowledge Database  

## Overview  
The **Knowledge Database** is a structured and extensible SQLite database designed to systematically organize reliable information on fairness, bias detection metrics, and real-world datasets across critical domains. It provides a transparent framework for understanding biases, mapping protected attributes to legal regulations, and supporting fairness-aware AI development.  

The database includes:  
- A comprehensive catalog of **bias detection metrics** and their applicability.  
- An indexed repository of **real-world datasets**, explicitly identifying known biases and protected groups studied in prior research.  
- A structured overview of **legal frameworks** from the U.S., UK, and EU, including the **EU AI Act**, mapping protected attributes to corresponding regulations.  
- A reference for **bias detection and mitigation frameworks**, summarizing their key features, supported metrics, and applicability.  

By enforcing structured queries over fairness-sensitive information, the **Knowledge Database** minimizes AI model hallucinations, improves explainability, and ensures compliance with evolving regulations. It is fully extensible, allowing users to define new fairness metrics, integrate domain-specific datasets, and expand legal mappings. Contributions can be versioned and updated as independent branches, supporting long-term scalability.
